# Dependencies
* discord.js (npm i discord.js)
* wokcommands (npm i wokcommands)
* mongoose (npm i mongoose)
* dotenv (npm i dotenv)
* ms (npm i ms)

// It's very recommended to also use MongoDB, as WOKCommands often relies on it.

# Setting up
Create a folder named 'Commands' and place 'giveaway.js' under it

Place all of the files in, and start customizing the different sections to your likings:
* Prefix and Token (Can be found in config.json)
* MongoDB Connection (Can be found in index.js)
* Giveaway Channel (The channel giveaways will be sent to - Can be found in giveaway.js)

The command will not work without you editing the code as above ^
